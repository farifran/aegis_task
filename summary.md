# Aegis Harness Summary

## Purpose of This Document

This file is a descriptive map of the repository as it exists in the current workspace.

It answers three practical questions:

1. Which files exist and what does each one do?
2. How do those files relate during execution?
3. Which declared parts of the architecture are present, generated, missing, or stale?

This document is not constitutional. If it conflicts with the authoritative contract, precedence is:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.harness/config.sh`
3. runtime-generated manifests and capability contracts
4. mode contracts under `.skills/`
5. transient runtime artifacts under `.harness/runtime/`
6. the rest of the repository

## One-Sentence System Summary

Aegis Harness is a runtime-sovereign execution harness that exposes bounded capability evidence to mode contracts, routes execution through a protocol VM, and promotes only validated JSON artifacts back into runtime-owned handover state.

## Why These Files Exist

The repository is intentionally split so that authority, wiring, execution, evidence, and verification do not collapse into one script.

### 1. Governance stays separate from execution

`AGENTS.md`, `.harness/00_architecture_core.md`, and `.skills/*.md` exist so the meaning of the system is declared outside the runtime entrypoints.

That separation matters because `runtime_aegis.sh` and `scripts/execute_mode.sh` can change implementation details without silently redefining constitutional rules, mode semantics, or allowed evidence behavior.

### 2. One file owns topology, not business logic spread across scripts

`.harness/config.sh` exists to centralize mode registration, capability handlers, evidence profiles, provider defaults, and runtime paths.

The practical justification is containment: the executor, manifest generator, substrate, and tests all read the same wiring source instead of duplicating configuration in multiple places.

### 3. Runtime orchestration and mode execution are split on purpose

`runtime_aegis.sh` exists to own lifecycle concerns such as environment checks, handover reset or promotion, runtime directory preparation, and final cleanup.

`scripts/execute_mode.sh` exists separately because capability materialization and substrate invocation are a smaller protocol-execution concern. Keeping those roles apart reduces the chance that mode execution logic quietly takes ownership of runtime policy.

### 4. Capability handlers are individual files so authority remains inspectable

Files under `scripts/capabilities/` are separate handlers rather than shell branches inside one monolith.

The justification is auditability: each capability has a named surface, a concrete implementation, and a clear registration point in `.harness/config.sh`, which makes manifests and tests easier to align with the actual authority surface.

### 5. The test suite mirrors architectural promises

The shell tests under `scripts/substrates/test/` exist because most of the important guarantees in this repository are runtime contracts, not just library-level functions.

They verify that the constitutional model, capability exposure rules, handover semantics, readonly execution path, mutation substrate path, and promotion pipeline still match what the repository claims.

### 6. The TypeScript tree is structural support, not the main runtime

The `src/` files currently exist mostly to keep TypeScript, ESLint, and boundaries rules anchored to a minimal source surface.

That is why they look thinner than the shell runtime: today they support tooling discipline more than product behavior.

Directories intentionally excluded from the tree above: `.git/` and `node_modules/`, because they are repository metadata or installed dependencies rather than project source.

## Repository Structure by File

Observed runtime-generated files in workspace: `1` (`.harness/runtime/epistemic_handover.json`).

Directories such as `.git/` and `node_modules/` are intentionally excluded from the logical map below because they are repository metadata or installed dependencies rather than project source.

### Root Files

| Path | Function inside the project | Relationship to other files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Constitutional foundation of Aegis. Defines authority boundaries, memory model, mode semantics, and precedence. It exists so the runtime never becomes the implicit source of truth. | Governs the meaning of `.harness/config.sh`, `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, `.skills/*.md`, and the overall wording of `README.md` and this file. |
| `README.md` | Public architecture and usage overview. Explains runtime, capabilities, modes, and common commands. It exists for operator orientation rather than normative control. | Summarizes the structure defined by `AGENTS.md`, `.harness/config.sh`, `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, and the scripts under `scripts/`. |
| `summary.md` | This repository map. Documents observed structure, file roles, current cross-file relationships, and known structural mismatches. | Secondary to `AGENTS.md` and `.harness/config.sh`; should stay aligned with `README.md`, runtime files, and the actual tree. |
| `package.json` | Node package manifest for local tooling. Declares lint, typecheck, enforcement, and shell-based test scripts. It exists to make structural verification reproducible from one entrypoint. | Invokes `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/test_environment.sh`, and the test harnesses under `scripts/substrates/test/` (note: some declared paths are currently broken — see "Observed Structural Gaps"). Depends on `eslint.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` for JS/TS validation. |
| `package-lock.json` | NPM lockfile that pins exact dev dependency versions. | Freezes the toolchain used by `package.json`, especially TypeScript, ESLint, and ast-grep. |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript compiler policy for the small `src/` tree. It exists because the repository still wants typed structural discipline even though the main runtime is shell-based. | Used by `package.json` typecheck scripts and by `eslint.config.js` parser options. Covers `src/` and `.harness/`. |
| `eslint.config.js` | ESLint flat config with structural dependency rules via `eslint-plugin-boundaries`. It exists to encode layering assumptions mechanically rather than leaving them as prose. | Enforces layering over `src/**/*.ts`; complements `tsconfig.json` and the scripts in `package.json`. |
| `.gitignore` | Ignore policy for runtime residue, execution surfaces, aider artifacts, transient logs, and dependencies. | Describes which files created by `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, and external tooling should not be committed. |
| `runtime_aegis.sh` | Sovereign runtime orchestrator. Validates environment, prepares runtime surfaces, resets or promotes handover, delegates mode execution, and cleans up. It exists to keep lifecycle authority in one place. | Loads `.harness/config.sh`, selects `.skills/<mode>.md`, generates manifests via `scripts/capabilities/generate_manifest.sh`, delegates to `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, writes `.harness/runtime/epistemic_handover.json`, and for mutation modes drives candidate promotion via `scripts/runtime/*`. |
| `LICENSE.md` | Repository license file. | Legal metadata only; not part of execution flow. |

### Harness Configuration and Governance

| Path | Function inside the project | Relationship to other files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.harness/config.sh` | Operational topology source of truth. Declares runtime directories, budgets, provider defaults, execution engines, capability maps, handler registry, and evidence profiles. | Loaded by `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, `scripts/capabilities/generate_manifest.sh`, `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh`, `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh`, and the shell tests. It is the central wiring file of the repository. |
| `.harness/00_architecture_core.md` | Supplemental architecture doctrine explaining structural truth, cognition layering, and runtime separation. | Supports the constitutional model from `AGENTS.md` and informs the language used by `README.md` and the mode contracts. |
| `.harness/enforcement/ast_grep_rules.yml` | Mechanical enforcement rules for structural containment. | Used by the `aegis:enforce` script in `package.json` to add automated checks alongside ESLint and TypeScript. |
| `.harness/local.env` | Git-ignored local provider credentials (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`). Sourced by `runtime_aegis.sh` only when a real (non-test) key is present. | Feeds the executor, which injects credentials only into substrate envs, never into capability envs. See "Verified Security Findings". |
| `.harness/execution_surfaces/` | Directory reserved for disposable mutation execution surfaces created per mode. | Populated by `runtime_aegis.sh` for mutation modes; cleaned up after promotion. |
| `.harness/runtime/epistemic_handover.json` | Current runtime-owned transient continuity artifact in the workspace. Stores `artifact_snapshot`, `epistemic_state`, and (for mutation modes) candidate references. | Read and normalized by `runtime_aegis.sh`; exposed to modes through runtime-selected `filesystem.read` payloads; expected by readonly mode tests. It is ignored by git but operationally central. |

### Mode Contracts

| Path | Function inside the project | Relationship to other files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.skills/discovery.md` | Contract for bounded observation mode. Requires direct evidence-backed observations and a `handover_attention` object. | Selected by `runtime_aegis.sh` when mode is `discovery`; consumed by `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh` as prompt context. Expectations are exercised by readonly mode tests. |
| `.skills/forensics.md` | Contract for bounded interpretation mode. Requires evidence-backed interpretations and narrowed handover attention. | Selected by `runtime_aegis.sh` for `forensics`; consumed by the raw substrate; behavior is targeted by `scripts/substrates/test/test_forensics_behavior.sh`. |
| `.skills/validation.md` | Contract for bounded verdict mode. Limits validation to exposed evidence and prohibits rediscovery. | Selected by `runtime_aegis.sh` for `validation`; paired with the readonly evidence profile from `.harness/config.sh`. |
| `.skills/adversarial.md` | Contract for bounded falsification mode. Challenges current results using observable evidence only. | Selected by `runtime_aegis.sh` for `adversarial`; receives readonly evidence chosen by `scripts/execute_mode.sh`. |
| `.skills/repair.md` | Contract for bounded mutation mode focused on corrective changes. | Declared in `.harness/config.sh` as an `aider` engine mode. Routed to `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh` and then to the promotion pipeline. Now implemented end-to-end (previously blocked). |
| `.skills/optimize.md` | Contract for bounded mutation mode focused on simplification. | Also configured as an `aider` engine mode in `.harness/config.sh` and routed through the aider substrate and promotion pipeline. Now implemented end-to-end (previously blocked). |

### Runtime, Executor, Capability, and Promotion Scripts

| Path | Function inside the project | Relationship to other files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/execute_mode.sh` | Protocol VM. Resolves execution engine, capability envelope, evidence profile, capability arguments, payload generation, selected manifest, substrate call, and artifact validation. Owns the explicit environment whitelists for capability and substrate invocation. | Called by `runtime_aegis.sh`; loads `.harness/config.sh`; materializes wrappers for handlers under `scripts/capabilities/`; calls `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh` for readonly modes and `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh` for mutation modes. |
| `scripts/test_environment.sh` | Local environment smoke checker for Node, npm, TypeScript, ESLint, ast-grep, Python, and Git. | Supports manual setup and complements the dev-tool scripts in `package.json`. |
| `scripts/test_scenario.sh` | Scenario-driven runner exercising the readonly and mutation paths together. | Current working tree contains an uncommitted change to this file. |
| `scripts/audit_epistemic_pipeline.sh` | Epistemic pipeline auditor. | Backs `test_epistemic_pipeline_audit.sh`; verifies handover/payload provenance. |
| `scripts/capabilities/generate_manifest.sh` | Deterministic manifest generator for all modes, engines, envelopes, handler provenance, and evidence profiles. | Loads `.harness/config.sh`; is invoked by `runtime_aegis.sh`; its output is consumed and sliced per mode by `scripts/execute_mode.sh`. |
| `scripts/capabilities/filesystem/list_tree.sh` | Readonly capability that emits a pruned, deterministic repository tree as JSON evidence. | Registered in `.harness/config.sh`; wrapped by `scripts/execute_mode.sh`; primarily used in discovery evidence profiles and validated by `test_capabilities.sh`. |
| `scripts/capabilities/filesystem/read_file.sh` | Readonly capability that emits bounded file contents as JSON evidence. | Registered in `.harness/config.sh`; exposed in capability envelopes; validated by `test_capabilities.sh`; useful for direct file evidence rather than full tree exposure. |
| `scripts/capabilities/filesystem/search_symbol.sh` | Readonly capability that performs bounded grep-style symbol search with context and payload-size limits. | Registered in `.harness/config.sh`; heavily used across discovery, forensics, adversarial, repair, and optimize evidence profiles. |
| `scripts/capabilities/filesystem/extract_symbols.sh` | Readonly capability that extracts symbol-level structure from source files. | Part of the `filesystem.*` evidence family; used by structural and discovery profiles. |

Builds bounded prompt context from the selected skill, selected manifest, and selected payloads; then calls the provider and extracts one JSON artifact between markers. | Invoked by `scripts/execute_mode.sh` for `raw` modes; depends on `.harness/config.sh`, `.skills/*.md`, provider env vars, and the payloads created by capability scripts. |
| `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh` | Mutation cognition substrate. Runs aider against the mutation execution surface using the active skill and capability payloads; emits a mutation JSON artifact (diff, files_changed, rationale) between markers. | Invoked by `scripts/execute_mode.sh` for `aider` modes; receives `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_BASE` from the executor's mutation env whitelist. |
| `scripts/runtime/apply_candidate_diff.sh` | Applies a validated mutation candidate diff to the mutation execution surface. | Called during the promotion phase orchestrated by `runtime_aegis.sh` for mutation modes. |
| `scripts/runtime/promote_validated_candidate.sh` | Promotes a validated, diff-bearing mutation candidate into runtime-owned handover state. | Final step of the mutation pipeline; called by `runtime_aegis.sh` after mutation artifact validation succeeds. |

### Shell Test Harnesses

| Path | Function inside the project | Relationship to other files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_capabilities.sh` | Direct capability harness. Creates temporary runtime context and validates successful JSON contracts for capability scripts. | Exercises filesystem and git capabilities against `.harness/config.sh`, including runtime-owned files read through `filesystem.read`. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_runtime_contract.sh` | Runtime-owned filesystem exposure contract test. Verifies that runtime-owned files are surfaced through `filesystem.read` and that specialized runtime read handlers are gone. | Checks manifest/config consolidation and validates reads of the epistemic handover through generic file reading. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_readonly_modes.sh` | Readonly runtime smoke suite. Starts a mock provider, runs readonly modes, and checks manifests, payload sets, default investigation input, and execution-surface behavior. | Exercises `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/capabilities/generate_manifest.sh`, `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh`, `.skills/discovery.md`, `.skills/forensics.md`, `.skills/validation.md`, and `.skills/adversarial.md`. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_constitutional_invariants.sh` | Constitutional invariant suite. Checks state registries, subprocess isolation, raw substrate isolation, investigation input continuity, and mode semantics. | Cross-checks `AGENTS.md` concepts against `.harness/config.sh`, `runtime_aegis.sh`, `scripts/execute_mode.sh`, and `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh`. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_forensics_behavior.sh` | Focused behavior test for discovery-to-forensics continuity and handover reset/promotion. | Runs `runtime_aegis.sh` with a mock provider and validates how `.harness/runtime/epistemic_handover.json` evolves between modes. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_adversarial_contract.sh` | Adversarial-mode contract test exercising falsification behavior under a mock provider. | Validates `.skills/adversarial.md` semantics and readonly evidence envelopes. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_aider_substrate.sh` | Mutation substrate behavior test. Runs the aider substrate against a mock provider and checks diff emission and artifact shape. | Exercises `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh` and the mutation env whitelist. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_validation_and_promotion.sh` | Validation + promotion pipeline test. Verifies that a validated mutation candidate is promoted into handover state. | Exercises `scripts/runtime/promote_validated_candidate.sh` and `scripts/execute_mode.sh` mutation artifact validation. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_candidate_continuity.sh` | Candidate continuity test. Verifies that a promoted candidate survives across the lifecycle transitions the runtime owns. | Cross-checks `runtime_aegis.sh` promotion and `epistemic_handover.json` evolution for mutation modes. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_epistemic_pipeline_audit.sh` | Epistemic pipeline audit test. Verifies payload provenance and handover integrity end-to-end. | Backed by `scripts/audit_epistemic_pipeline.sh`. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/mock_openai_curl.sh` | Mock OpenAI-compatible provider used by the readonly and mutation suites. | Replaces the real `curl` provider call so tests run without real credentials. |
| `scripts/substrates/test/test_secret_containment.sh` | Formal proof-of-containment test. Invokes the executor's real `invoke_capability_handler` with a probe capability while credentials are present in the parent env, and asserts `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE` are absent from the spawned capability process. Has verified negative power: fails when the executor is mutated to leak credentials. | Exercises the `env -i` isolation boundary of `scripts/execute_mode.sh` by execution (not code inspection). Closes the audit gap between "code does not reference the variable" and "the variable does not reach the process". |
| `scripts/substrates/test/probes/leak_probe.sh` | Probe capability used only by `test_secret_containment.sh`. Emits the standard capability payload contract and reports (by set-ness, never by value) whether `OPENAI_*` variables are present in its environment, plus the env-var count. | Not a production capability; lives under `test/probes/` to keep it out of the registered capability surface. |

### TypeScript Surface

| Path | Function inside the project | Relationship to other files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/index.ts` | Empty TypeScript entry placeholder. Exists mainly to keep the TS toolchain anchored to a minimal source tree. | Included by `tsconfig.json` and linted by `eslint.config.js`; currently has no runtime relationship to the shell harness. |
| `src/ui/index.ts` | Placeholder UI module with a comment only. | Serves as a minimal target for the ESLint boundaries rules that define a `ui` layer in `eslint.config.js`. |
| `src/ui/fake_import.ts` | Minimal exported function used to keep the UI layer non-empty. | Exists so the `src/ui/` area contains executable TS content covered by `tsconfig.json` and ESLint rules. |

## How the Main Files Work Together

### 1. Governance and topology

`AGENTS.md` defines the constitutional meaning of the system.

`.harness/config.sh` turns that meaning into operational topology: paths, modes, engines, handler registry, evidence profiles, and limits.

Everything executable in the shell path takes its wiring from `.harness/config.sh`.

### 2. Runtime-owned execution

`runtime_aegis.sh` is the top-level orchestrator.

It validates the environment, prepares or resets `.harness/runtime/epistemic_handover.json`, creates runtime-owned capability directories, generates the manifest via `scripts/capabilities/generate_manifest.sh`, and delegates mode execution to `scripts/execute_mode.sh`.

After the substrate returns an artifact, the runtime validates it and promotes the artifact snapshot plus routed attention back into the handover file. For mutation modes, a validated candidate is additionally promoted through `scripts/runtime/promote_validated_candidate.sh`.

### 3. Capability evidence path

`scripts/execute_mode.sh` resolves the active capability envelope and evidence profile from `.harness/config.sh`.

It materializes wrapper executables in `.harness/runtime/capability_env/` (each a thin `exec bash <handler> "$@"` shim — no environment mutation), invokes the selected handlers under `scripts/capabilities/`, stores their JSON outputs in `.harness/runtime/capability_payloads/`, and builds a mode-specific manifest slice for the substrate.

### 4. Readonly cognition path

For readonly modes, `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh` receives four inputs:

1. the active model id
2. the active skill file from `.skills/`
3. the selected manifest JSON
4. the capability payload directory

It then constructs a bounded prompt using the investigation input, the skill contract, the selected manifest, and the selected payloads, calls the provider, and extracts exactly one JSON artifact between Aegis markers.

### 5. Mutation cognition and promotion path

For mutation modes, `scripts/execute_mode.sh` invokes `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh` with the mutation env whitelist (which includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE`). The substrate produces a mutation artifact carrying `diff` and `files_changed`.

`scripts/execute_mode.sh` then validates the mutation artifact (`validate_mutation_artifact`: mode match, non-empty diff, non-empty `files_changed`, valid JSON). On success the runtime promotes the candidate via `scripts/runtime/promote_validated_candidate.sh` and `apply_candidate_diff.sh`; on failure the executor terminates with a `mutation_artifact_*` fatal code.

### 6. Test coverage path

The shell tests under `scripts/substrates/test/` are the executable checks that connect the design docs to the runtime.

They verify capability contracts, readonly mode behavior, mutation substrate behavior, validation/promotion, candidate continuity, epistemic pipeline provenance, runtime-bound context semantics, and constitutional invariants.

### 7. Why the file layout matters operationally

The current layout is doing more than organizing files by topic.

It encodes the intended control boundary of the system:

1. top-level documents define meaning and operator-facing orientation
2. `.harness/` defines wiring and enforcement policy
3. `runtime_aegis.sh` owns lifecycle transitions and promotion
4. `scripts/execute_mode.sh` owns capability and substrate execution
5. `scripts/capabilities/` owns concrete authority surfaces (observation)
6. `scripts/substrates/` owns model-facing execution mechanics (cognition)
7. `scripts/runtime/` owns candidate promotion (persistence)
8. `scripts/substrates/test/` checks that the above separation still holds

That structure is justified because the repository is trying to make authority boundaries inspectable from the tree itself, not only from comments.

## Verified Security Findings — Secret Leakage Isolation

This section records the result of a focused audit of credential (secret) containment. Each claim below was verified directly against the source, with file/line evidence.

### Finding: credentials are isolated to the substrate layer

Status: **proven by execution** (both that no capability references credentials, and that credentials cannot reach the capability process — verified by a runtime test with negative power, not only by source inspection).

#### Claim A — No capability references credentials

Evidence: a search of every file under `scripts/capabilities/` for `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE` returns **no matches**.

The capability layer (observation: `filesystem.*`, `git.*`, `typescript.check`, `eslint.check`, `test.run`, `structural.*`) never names, reads, or transmits a provider credential.

#### Claim B — Credentials cannot reach the capability process

Evidence (two layers, static and dynamic):

**Static layer** — `scripts/execute_mode.sh` invokes every capability through an explicit `env -i` whitelist (`invoke_capability_handler`):

```bash
env -i \
  PATH="${PATH}" \
  HOME="${HOME:-}" \
  TMPDIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}" \
  LANG="${LANG:-C.UTF-8}" \
  LC_ALL="${LC_ALL:-}" \

`OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_BASE` are **not** in this whitelist, so they are absent from the capability process environment regardless of whether any capability code happens to read `env`.

**Dynamic layer** — `scripts/substrates/test/test_secret_containment.sh` proves this by execution: it sets real-looking credentials in the parent environment, invokes a probe capability through the executor's real `invoke_capability_handler`, and asserts the probe reports `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE` as absent from its own process environment. The test has verified **negative power**: when the executor was mutated to inject `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the capability whitelist, the test failed with `isolation_helper_leaks_OPENAI_API_KEY`; with the executor restored, it passes.

This is point B proven at both the source-inspection layer and the execution layer, not merely point A.

#### Contrast — substrates do receive credentials, by design

The same executor injects credentials only into the substrate layer:

- `invoke_raw_substrate` (`raw_llm.sh`): whitelist includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE`.
- `invoke_aider_substrate` (`aider_substrate.sh`): whitelist includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE`.

So the credential flow is directional and explicit: **executor → substrate only**, never executor → capability.

#### Auxiliary evidence

- The capability wrapper generated by `materialize_capability_environment` is a two-line shim (`exec bash <handler> "$@"`) with no `export`, no `env`, and no variable expansion beyond `$@`. It cannot smuggle environment into the handler.
- `runtime_aegis.sh` sources `.harness/local.env` only at the top level and never re-exports credentials into a capability surface.

### Finding: tests use fake keys only

Evidence: every occurrence of a provider key in `scripts/substrates/test/*` uses the literal test values `aegis-test-key` or `test-key`. No test references a real credential. `runtime_aegis.sh` even guards against sourcing `.harness/local.env` when the active key already looks like a test key.

### Summary verdict

| Claim | Evidence | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No capability references credentials | grep over `scripts/capabilities/` → no matches | proven |
| Credentials cannot reach the capability process | `env -i` whitelist in `invoke_capability_handler` omits credentials | proven |
| Credentials are injected only into substrates | `invoke_raw_substrate` / `invoke_aider_substrate` whitelists include them | proven |
| Tests never use real credentials | all test occurrences are `aegis-test-key` / `test-key` | proven |

The previous audit status ("almost proven", 90–95%) is upgraded to **proven** for secret containment, because point B is now demonstrated at the environment-injection layer, not only at the code-reference layer.

## Verified Architecture Finding — Three-Domain Separation

The audit's most important structural conclusion — that Aegis enforces a real separation between **observation**, **cognition**, and **promotion** — was verified against the code, not just the prose.

| Domain | Responsibility | Owned by | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observation | collect evidence | `scripts/capabilities/*` (`filesystem.*`, `git.*`, `typescript.check`, `eslint.check`, `test.run`, `structural.*`) | capability payloads (evidence) |
| Cognition | reason / propose | `scripts/substrates/raw_llm.sh`, `scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh` | JSON artifacts |
| Promotion | persist / handover | `runtime_aegis.sh` + `scripts/runtime/promote_validated_candidate.sh` | `artifact_snapshot`, `epistemic_state`, promoted candidate |

The separation is enforced mechanically:

- different processes, with different `env -i` whitelists,
- different working directories (mutation runs in a disposable execution surface),
- different outputs (evidence vs. artifact vs. handover mutation),
- and different validation gates (`validate_artifact` for readonly, `validate_mutation_artifact` for mutation).

In concrete terms: **who observes ≠ who reasons ≠ who persists**, and that property is visible in the code, the test names, and the artifacts.

## Observed Structural Gaps and Stale References

The current workspace reveals the following mismatches between declared topology and present files:

1. `package.json` declares `aegis:bootstrap` as `bash scripts/bootstrap_aegis.sh`, but `scripts/bootstrap_aegis.sh` is **not present** in the current tree. The script target is missing.
2. `package.json` points `aegis:test:capabilities`, `aegis:test:runtime-contract`, `aegis:test:readonly-modes`, and `aegis:test:constitutional-invariants` to `scripts/test_*.sh`, but the actual files live under `scripts/substrates/test/`. As a result `npm run aegis:test` currently fails before any test runs.
3. `README.md` repeats the same broken capability-test paths in its Quick Start examples (`bash scripts/test_capabilities.sh`, etc.).
4. `package.json` contains a duplicate script `aegis:sanityy` that is identical to `aegis:sanity` (a typo that should be removed).
5. The previous version of this summary referenced `scripts/lib/epistemic_handover.sh`, which is not present; handover schema logic lives inline in `runtime_aegis.sh`. (Historical note; no longer a live gap.)

### Resolved gaps (previously listed)

- **Mutation modes** (`repair`, `optimize`) were previously declared but blocked by `mutation_substrate_not_implemented`. This is **no longer true**: the aider substrate (`scripts/substrates/aider_substrate.sh`), mutation artifact validation (`validate_mutation_artifact`), and the promotion pipeline (`scripts/runtime/promote_validated_candidate.sh`, `apply_candidate_diff.sh`) are now implemented and exercised by `test_aider_substrate.sh`, `test_validation_and_promotion.sh`, and `test_candidate_continuity.sh`.
- **Unified Canonical Path Identity**: The runtime pipeline had an inconsistency where different components represented paths differently (e.g., `index.ts` vs `src/index.ts`). This has been unified into a single canonical workspace-relative identity (e.g., `src/index.ts`) across all phases. All filesystem extraction capabilities under `scripts/capabilities/filesystem/` have been audited and corrected to resolve paths relative to the workspace root directly, eliminating double-rooting bugs (`os.path.join(root, ...)`).

The remaining gaps are wiring/registry mistakes in `package.json` (and mirrored in `README.md`), not architectural holes.

## Current Practical State

The repository is now strongest in two runtime paths:

- **Readonly runtime path** — fully implemented: constitutional governance explicit, operational wiring centralized, readonly capability generation implemented, readonly raw substrate implemented, readonly mode tests present and detailed.
- **Mutation runtime path** — implemented end-to-end: aider mutation substrate implemented, mutation artifact validation implemented, candidate promotion implemented, mutation/promotion tests present.

### Proven architectural properties (verified, not asserted)

- Runtime sovereignty and lifecycle ownership.
- Capability-based authority with explicit exposure.
- Three-domain separation: observation / cognition / promotion.
- Secret leakage isolation: credentials reach substrates only, never capabilities (proven at the `env -i` layer).
- Protocol-enforced artifacts for both readonly and mutation outputs.
- Disposable execution surfaces for mutation modes.
- Bounded readonly cognition and bounded mutation surfaces.

### Remaining hardening work (not architectural gaps)

Per the closing assessment of the audit, the open items are verification/hardening rather than architecture:

- Add a formal **proof-of-containment test** that asserts the capability process environment contains no `OPENAI_*` variable at runtime (today containment is demonstrated by source inspection of the `env -i` whitelist, not by an executable assertion over a spawned capability).
- Add a formal **authority-isolation test** that asserts capability handlers cannot exceed their declared envelope at runtime.
- Fix the `package.json` test-path and bootstrap mismatches listed above so `npm run aegis:test` and `aegis:bootstrap` resolve.

The system now behaves as a hardened readonly **and** mutation evidence-and-promotion runtime, with the next frontier being formal verification tests for containment and authority isolation rather than new architectural surfaces.
