# test_execution_boundary.sh — Constitutional proof: Execution Boundary isolation.
#
# Purpose:
#   Proves, by execution (not code inspection), that run_bounded_mode() builds
#   a clean process environment. Bootstrap-layer variables (PIPELINE, RESUME,
#   UNTIL, TARGET, ISSUE_PATH, ISSUE_NUMBER) must be physically absent from
#   the Runtime subprocess. Only the eight authorized variables may cross the
#   boundary.
#
#   Two proofs:
#   (A) Static: run_bounded_mode() contains `env -i`.
#   (B) Dynamic: A mock runtime_aegis.sh captures its own env. We assert that
#       unauthorized vars are absent and authorized vars are present.
#
# Constitutional reference: RFC §5 Execution Boundary Contract.
